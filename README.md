Key: your ssh key - below you will find instruction how to generate  


#### Generating SSH public key

`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "your@email.com"`

-t ed25519 → modern algorithm (recommeded)
-C → comment (i.e. your e-mail from github)

you will be asked for some info, but you can leave it empty by pressing just enter.

If everything went good you will have your public key available here
C:\Users\<your_name>\.ssh\id_ed25519.pub

you can open it in notepad or via command: 
`cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub`

copy your key - it looks like this:
